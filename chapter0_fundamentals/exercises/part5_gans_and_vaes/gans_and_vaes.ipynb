        "## How GANs work\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea behind GANs is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You have two networks, the **generator** and the **discriminator**.\n",
        "* The generator's job is to produce output realistic enough to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator's job is to try and tell the difference between real and fake output.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is for both networks to be trained simultaneously, in a positive feedback loop: as the generator produces better output, the discriminator's job becomes harder, and it has to learn to spot more subtle features distinguishing real and fake images, meaning the generator has to work harder to produce images with those features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discriminator\n",
        "\n",
        "The discriminator works by taking an image (either real, or created by the generator), and outputting a single value between 0 and 1, which is the probability that the discriminator puts on the image being real. The discriminator sees the images, but not the labels (i.e. whether the images are real or fake), and it is trained to distinguish between real and fake images with maximum accuracy. The discriminator's loss function is the cross entropy between its probability estimates ($D(x)$ for real images, $D(G(z))$ for fake images) and the true labels ($1$ for real images, $0$ for fake images).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of generators in a GAN setup is generally a mirror image of the discriminator, with convolutions swapped out for **transposed convolutions**. This is the case for the DCGAN paper we'll be reading (which is why they only give a diagram of the generator, not both). The generator works by taking in a vector $z$, whose elements are all normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1. We call the space from which $z$ is sampled **latent dimension** or **latent space**, and we call $z$ a **latent vector**. The formal definition of a latent space is *an abstract multi-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.* We'll dive a little deeper into what this means and the overall significance of latent spaces later on, but for now it's fine to understand this vector $z$ as a kind of random seed, which causes the generator to produce different outputs. After all, if the generator only ever produced the same image as output then the discriminator's job would be pretty easy (just subtract the image $g$ always produces from the input image, and see if the result is close to zero!). The generator's objective function is an increasing function of $D(G(z))$, in other words it tries to produce images $G(z)$ which have a high chance of fooling the discriminator (i.e. $D(G(z)) \\approx 1$).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Convergence\n",
        "\n",
        "The ideal outcome when training a GAN is for the generator to produce perfect output indistringuishable from real images, and the discriminator just guesses randomly. However, the precise nature of the situations when GANs converge is an ongoing area of study (in general, adversarial networks have very unstable training patterns). For example, you can imagine a situation where the discriminator becomes almost perfect at spotting fake outputs, because of some feature that the discriminator spots and that the generator fails to capture in its outputs. It will be very difficult for the generator to get a training signal, because it has to figure out what feature is missing from its outputs, and how it can add that feature to fool the discriminator. And to make matters worse, maybe marginal steps in that direction will only increase the probability of fooling the discriminator from almost-zero to slightly-more-than-almost-zero, which isn't much of a training signal! Later on we will see techniques people have developed to overcome problems like this and others, but in general they can't be solved completely.\n",
        "\n",
        "<details>\n",
        "<summary>Optional exercise - what conditions must hold for the discriminator's best strategy to be random guessing with probability 0.5?</summary>\n",
        "\n",
        "It is necessary for the generator to be producing perfect outputs, because otherwise the discriminator could do better than random guessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the generator is producing perfect outputs, then the discriminator never has any ability to distinguish real from fake images, so it has no information. Its job is to minimise the cross entropy between its output distribution $(D(x), 1-D(x))$, and the distribution of real/fake images. Call this $(p, 1-p)$, i.e. $p$ stands for the proportion of images in training which are real. Note how we just used $p$ rather than $p(x)$, because there's no information in the image $x$ which indicates whether it is real or fake. Trying to minimize the cross entropy between $(p, 1-p)$ and $(D(x), 1-D(x))$ gives us the solution $D(x) = p$ for all $x$. In other words, our discriminator guesses real/fake randomly with probability equal to the true underlying frequency of real/fake images in the data. This is 0.5 if and only if the data contains an equal number of real and fake images.\n",
        "\n",

        "**What are transposed convolutions, and why should we care about them?** One high-level intuition goes something like this: most of the generator's architecture is basically the discriminator architecture in reverse. We need something that performs the reverse of a convolution - not literally the inverse operation, but something reverse in spirit, which uses a kernel of weights to project up to some array of larger size.\n",

Note the difference in size between the output in both cases. With standard convolutions, our output is smaller than our input, because we're having to fit the kernel inside the input in order to produce the output. But in our transposed convolutions, the output is actually larger than the input, because we're fitting the kernel inside the output.\n",

        "\n",
        "The key perspective shift is this: **rather than mapping the input into a fixed vector, we map it into a distribution**. The way we learn a distribution is very similar to the way we learn our fixed inputs for the autoencoder, i.e. we have a bunch of linear or convolutional layers, our input is the original image, and our output is the tuple of parameters $(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x}))$ (as a trivial example, our VAE learning a distribution $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})=z(\\boldsymbol{x})$, $\\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})=0$ is equivalent to our autoencoder learning the function $z(\\boldsymbol{x})$ as its encoder).\n",

        "\n",

        "With our encoder, there was nothing incentivising us to make full and meaningful use of the latent space. It's hypothetically possible that our network was mapping all the inputs to some very small subspace and reconstructing them with perfect fidelity. This wouldn't have required numbers with different features to be far apart from each other in the latent space, because even if they are close together no information is lost. See the first image above.\n",
        "\n",
        "But with our variational autoencoder, each MNIST image produces a **sample** from the latent space, with a certain mean and variance.

        "Another nice property of using random latent vectors is that the entire latent space will be meaningful. For instance, with autoencoders there is no reason why we should expect the linear interpolation between two points in the latent space to have meaningful decodings. The decoder output *will* change continuously as we continuously vary the latent vector, but that's about all we can say about it. However, if we use a variational autoencoder, we don't have this problem. The output of a linear interpolation between the cluster of $2$s and cluster of $7$s will be ***\"a symbol which pattern-matches to the family of MNIST digits, but has equal probability to be interpreted as a $2$ or a $7$\"***, and this is indeed what we find.\n",

We know how to differentiate with respect to the inputs to a function, but how can we differentiate wrt the parameters of a probability distribution from which we sample our vector? The solution is to convert our random sampling into a function, by introducing an extra parameter $\\epsilon$. We sample $\\epsilon$ from the standard normal distribution, and then express $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as a deterministic function of $\\mu$, $\\sigma$ and $\\epsilon$:\n",

This is why it's important to add a KL-divergence term to the loss function, to make sure this doesn't happen. It's also why, if you print out the average value of $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})$ while training, you'll probably see it stay below 1 (it's being pulled towards 1 by the KL-divergence loss, **and** pulled towards 0 by the reconstruction loss).\n",
