To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction.

Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n",

        "## Batch Size\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n",
        "\n",
        "At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not \"bounce around\" too much.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n",

        "\n",

        "For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs. Note that PyTorch will implement weight decay on the weights *and* biases of linear layers by default - see the bonus exercises tomorrow for more on this.\n"

Don't peek at what other people online have done for CIFAR10 (it's a common benchmark), because the point is to develop your own process by which you can figure out how to improve your model. Just reading the results of someone else would prevent you from learning how to get the answers. To get an idea of what's possible: using one V100 and a modified ResNet, one entry in the DAWNBench competition was able to achieve 94% test accuracy in 24 epochs and 76 seconds. 94% is approximately [human level performance](http://karpathy.github.io/2011/04/27/manually-classifying-cifar10/).\n",

        "* The `validation_step` method performs a single evaluation of a batch of data, and returns number of correct classifications.\n",
        "    * Note the use of the decorator `torch.inference_mode()` for this method, which stops gradients propagating.\n",
        "* The `train` method repeatedly calls `training_step` and `validation_step`, and logs the loss and accuracy at each step.\n",
        "    * Note that we've called `model.train()` and `model.eval()` before the training and evaluation steps respectively. This is important because the model has BatchNorm layers, which behave differently in training vs eval mode (in our simple MLP, we didn't have this problem).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the optimizer has been defined to only update the parameters in the final layer of the model. This is a common strategy for fine-tuning pretrained models (especially image classifiers). The term for this is **feature extraction**. We've also used the function `get_resnet_for_feature_extraction`, which returns a version of the `ResNet34` model, but with this final layer replaced with a randomly initialized linear layer, with number of output features equal to `args.n_classes`.

Searching the product of sets takes exponential time, so is really only feasible if there are a small number of hyperparameters. I would recommend forgetting about grid search if you have more than 3 hyperparameters, which in deep learning is \"always\".\n",

You can manually abort runs that don't look promising, or you can try to do it automatically; [Hyperband](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf) is a popular algorithm for this.\n",

        "    - Learning rate is often the most important single hyperparameter, so it's important to get a good-enough value early.\n",
        "    - Eventually, you'll want a learning rate schedule. Usually, you'll start low and gradually increase, then gradually decrease but many other schedules are feasible. [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) has a good blog post on learning rates.\n",
        "    - Larger batch size increases GPU memory usage and doubling batch size [often allows doubling learning rate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf), up to a point where this relationship breaks down. The heuristic is that larger batches give a more accurate estimate of the direction to update in. Note that on the test set, you can vary the batch size independently and usually the largest value that will fit on your GPU will be the most efficient.\n",
        "- Add regularization to reduce the amount of overfitting and train for longer to see if it's enough.\n",
        "    - Data augmention is the first thing to do - flipping the image horizontally and Cutout are known to be effective.\n",
