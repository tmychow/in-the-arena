        "### Tip - Elementwise Logical Operations on Tensors\n",
        "\n",
        "For regular booleans, the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` are used to do logical operations and the operators `&`, `|`, and `~` do and, or and not on each bit of the input numbers. For example `0b10001 | 0b11000` is `0b11001` or 25 in base 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tragically, Python doesn't allow classes to overload keywords, so if `x` and `y` are of type `torch.Tensor`, then `x and y` does **not** do the natural thing that you probably expect, which is compute `x[i] and y[i]` elementwise. It actually tries to coerce `x` to a regular boolean, which throws an exception.\n",

        "As a workaround, PyTorch (and NumPy) have chosen to overload the bitwise operators but have them actually mean logical operations, since you usually don't care to do bitwise operations on tensors. So the correct expression would be `x & y` to compute `x[i] and y[i]` elementwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another gotcha when it comes to logical operations - **operator precedence**. For instance, `v >= 0 & v <= 1` is actually evaluated as `(v >= (0 & v)) <= 1` (because `&` has high precedence). When in doubt, use parentheses to force the correct parsing: `(v >= 0) & (v <= 1)`.\n",

The efficient way to do this in PyTorch is with `torch.any()` or equivalently the `.any()` method of a tensor, which accept the dimension to reduce over. Similarly, `torch.all()` or `.all()` method.

        "* GPT is great at writing tests (asking it to write a test for a function is often better than asking it if a function is correct), refactoring code (identifying repeated tasks and extracting them) and naming variables well. These are specific things worth doing a few times to see how useful they can be.\n",
        "* GPT-4 does well with whole modules/scripts so don't hesitate to add those.

        "To wrap up today, we're going to have a further discussion of **testing**. So far, our test functions have been pretty simple - we imported a test from the `part1_ray_tracing/tests.py` file, and ran it to compare our answers to the answers in `part1_ray_tracing/solutions.py`. This works perfectly fine, but there are other Python libraries which can make testing easier and more powerful. In particular, two such libraries are `unittest` and `pytest`. Both these libraries provide extensive features for modularizing and running test functions, and have nice integrations with VSCode. `unittest` is very powerful, but also has a steep learning curve and isn't worth the trouble of learning during a 6 week course. However, `pytest` is very useful and easy to learn, so we'll spend some time here discussing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. Today we'll just discuss a few features which will be particularly useful for the kinds of tests we'll be writing, but you're welcome to explore more tests later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Important note - if you're working on Colab or a notebook for these exercises, your tests won't work, because in this setup we'll be importing answers from our test file, rather than importing tests from our answers file. For this reason, we won't be using pytest for the structured exercises in this course (in case anybody is following these exercises in a notebook), but you're strongly recommended to use pytest when you're working from `.py` files instead - which is strongly recommended during much of the bonus content.*\n",
        "\n",
        "First, look at `part1_ray_tracing/tests.py`. The tests in this file all follow a similar pattern: evaluate your function on some input, check it equals the solution. This is a clear sign that we can use modularization to simplify our code! Compare this file to `part1_ray_tracing/test_with_pytest.py`, which contains the same tests but refactored using pytest. The latter is clearly separated into three sections: one for library imports, one for defining the inputs we'll use for our test functions, and one where we define our test functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parametrization\n",
        "\n",
        "We use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to parametrize our tests. This means we can run the same test a bunch of different times on different inputs. In the non-pytest version, we did this by defining different functions (e.g. `test_intersect_ray_1d` and `test_intersect_ray_1d_special_case`), but this isn't necessary here.\n",
        "\n",
        "The syntax of a function decorated by `pytest.mark.parametrize` is:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"arg1, arg2, arg3\", [\n",
        "    (val1, val2, val3),\n",
        "    (val4, val5, val6),\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "])\n",
        "def test_function(arg1, arg2, arg3):\n",
        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This will result in running `test_function` multiple times, the first time with `arg1=val1, arg2=val2, arg3=val3`, and the second time with `arg1=val4, arg2=val5, arg3=val6`, etc. This is a much better way to write tests, because it makes it easy for us to add new test cases without having to write new functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to run these tests?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three ways to run the above tests:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **From the terminal**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can run them from the command line using the pytest command. Open your terminal in VSCode at the bottom of the screen, make sure you're in the directory `chapter0_fundamentals`, then enter the command `pytest`. This will search the current directory (or subdirectories) for any python files with the prefix `test_`, and within that file run all functions with the prefix `test_` (i.e. all the tests for these exercises).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also add more complicated commands, like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `pytest test_intersect_ray_1d` to specify the file to run tests from\n",
        "* `pytest test_intersect_ray_1d::test_intersect_ray_1d` to specify the file and test function\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **From your Python file**\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, you need to call `pytest.main` (make sure this is wrapped in an `if MAIN` block). The first argument of this function is a list of args to `pytest`. This has analogous syntax to the command line option, for instance here are a few ways you can do this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if MAIN:\n",
        "    pytest.main([])\n",
        "    pytest.main([\"test_part1_ray_tracing.py\"])\n",
        "    pytest.main([\"test_part1_ray_tracing.py::test_intersect_ray_1d\"])\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **From VSCode's testing display**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is by far the most useful way to run test functions. VSCode provides a helpful interface to run all test functions in your directory, and see which of them have passed. First, press the test icon on the left hand sidebar (it will look like a triangular flask). If this is your first time, then you'll need to click on the **Configure Python Tests** button, then select `pytest` as your framework (you may have to install pytest when prompted). This should automatically perform test discovery for you, showing you all the test files & functions in your current directory in the left hand window (it detects this the same way pytest does, using the `test_` prefix). You can hover over tests or files to see options like \"run test(s)\" or debug test(s)\". When you run them, you'll see a tick or cross appear next to the test, indicating whether it passed or failed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a very useful interface when you're working on a large project, because as you make updates you can easily re-run all tests, then identify & fix problems.\n",
